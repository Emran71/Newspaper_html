                    <div>
                        Amid protests by battery-run rickshaws and auto-rickshaws drivers, the government has decided to
                        move a petition before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court seeking stay a High Court
                        order that asked to take steps to stop plying of their vehicles on the Dhaka roads.<br>
                        <input type="checkbox" id="read-more">

                        <label for="read-more">&#9654; Read more...</label>
                        <div id="extra-content">
                            We are preparing petition against the High Court directive. We may move the petition before
                            the chamber judge of the Appellate Division today or tomorrow," Deputy Attorney General Nur
                            Muhammad Azami told The Daily Star today.

                            He said the stay petition will contain a ground that allowing battery-run rickshaws or
                            auto-rickshaws on the streets is a policy decision of the government and therefore, the HC
                            cannot interfere in this decision.

                            On November 20, the HC directed the government authorities concerned to take necessary steps
                            to stop the plying of battery-run rickshaws and auto-rickshaws on the capital's streets
                            within three days, aiming to reduce road accidents.It also issued a rule asking the
                            authorities to explain why their failure to halt the operation of these vehicles should not
                            be declared illegal.

                            The directive was issued by the bench of Justice Fatema Najib and Justice Sikder Mahmudur
                            Razi, following a writ petition filed by Greater Dhaka City Corporation Rickshaw Owners
                            Unity Alliance.

                            The petition challenged the authorities' lack of action in preventing unlicenced battery-run
                            rickshaws from operating in the city, petitioners' lawyer Barrister Shanjid Siddique told
                            The Daily Star on that day.

                    <h3><a href="#">Calls grow to save Thailand's free medicine policy</a></h3>
                    <div>
                        A civil society group has expressed deep concern over the Medical Council of Thailand's legal
                        action against the National Health Security Office (NHSO) regarding its free medicine policy for
                        universal healthcare cardholders, reads a Bangkok Post report.<br>
                        <input type="checkbox" id="read-more_1">

                        <label for="read-more_1">&#9654; Read more...</label>
                        <div id="extra-content_1">
                            The policy, introduced in 2022, allows pharmacies to dispense free medication for 16 common
                            ailments, including headaches, fever, sore throat, diarrhea, and muscle pain. Advocates
                            claim it has saved lives, reduced hospital congestion, and eased the burden on medical
                            staff.

                            Saree Aongsomwang, secretary-general of the Thailand Consumer Council (TCC), urged the
                            Medical Council to immediately withdraw its lawsuit, emphasizing the potential harm to
                            patients. "This dispute is not just about governance but also about patient safety. Minor
                            symptoms, if left untreated, can escalate into serious conditions," she said.

                            The Supreme Administrative Court recently accepted the Medical Council's complaint,
                            intensifying concerns over the policy's future. Saree noted that the policy aligns with the
                            Ministry of Public Health's goals to strengthen primary healthcare and offers patients the
                            choice of seeking treatment at pharmacies or hospitals.

                            "This lawsuit has created confusion and fear among consumers, who worry the service might be
                            terminated. We urge the Medical Council to withdraw the case and collaborate with other
                            stakeholders to prioritize patient welfare," she added.

                            NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr. Attaporn Limpanyalert assured the public that universal
                            healthcare cardholders would continue to benefit from the policy until a court ruling is
                            made.

                            The Pharmacy Council of Thailand has also defended the program, reporting that since its
                            launch, over 1.79 million people have received treatment, with a 90% recovery rate and no
                            severe complications or fatalities linked to the service.

                            The Pharmacy Council criticized the Medical Council's opposition, pointing out that while it
                            does not challenge individuals buying medicines themselves, it targets the NHSO's free
                            medicine initiative. The council called for mutual respect among medical professionals and
                            questioned whether the Medical Council's stance truly prioritizes patient safety.

                            As public anxiety grows, civil society groups and healthcare advocates hope for a resolution
                            that protects patient access to affordable care while maintaining professional standards.

                        The Under-19 Asia Cup is set to take place in the United Arab Emirates this month. Bangladesh
                        has selected a 14-member squad with Azizul Hakim Tamim as the captain.<br>

                            The Bangladesh U-19 team flew to the Middle Eastern country on Sunday morning (November 24)
                            to participate in the tournament. Before leaving the country, captain Tamim expressed his
                            team’s ambition to win both the upcoming Asia Cup and the Youth World Cup.

                            Earlier, the Bangladesh U-19 team held an official photoshoot. Following that, captain
                            Azizul Hakim Tamim spoke to the media. Bangladesh is the current champion of the tournament,
                            and Tamim expressed optimism about retaining the title, saying, "We are the reigning
                            champions. Our team includes five players who won the previous Asia Cup. We are very
                            confident that we can win the title again."

                            Last Thursday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced the 14-member U-19 squad.

                            Bangladesh is placed in Group A of this year’s Under-19 Asia Cup, where they will face Sri
                            Lanka, Pakistan, and Nepal. Meanwhile, Group B consists of India, Pakistan, the United Arab
                            Emirates, and Japan. Bangladesh will play Afghanistan in their opening match on the first
                            day of the tournament. Tamim's team will face Nepal in their second match on December 1, and
                            conclude the group stage against Sri Lanka on December 3.
